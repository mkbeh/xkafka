# Kafka Library

This library provides an API for working with Kafka, using franz-go
and integration with OpenTelemetry for tracing and metrics.
The library implements messages producing and consuming.

## Features

- Support for asynchronous and synchronous message sending
- Transactions
- Customizable message handlers for consumers
- Observability

## Getting started

Here's a basic overview of producing and consuming:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/mkbeh/xkafka"
	"github.com/twmb/franz-go/pkg/kgo"
)

func main() {
	// One client can only produce!
	producer, err := kafka.NewProducer()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer producer.Close()

	ctx := context.Background()

	// Producing a message
	record := &kgo.Record{Topic: "foo", Value: []byte("bar")}
	producer.ProduceAsync(ctx, record)

	// Alternatively, ProduceSync exists to synchronously produce a batch of records.
	err = producer.ProduceSync(ctx, record)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Consuming messages from a topic
	consumer, err := kafka.NewConsumer(
		kafka.WithConsumerConfig(&kafka.ConsumerConfig{Topics: "foo"}),
		kafka.WithConsumerHandler(func(ctx context.Context, msg *kgo.Record) error {
			fmt.Printf("received msg: %+v\n", msg)
			return nil
		}),
	)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	err = consumer.PreRun(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	err = consumer.Run(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	consumer.Shutdown(ctx)
}

```

## Options
